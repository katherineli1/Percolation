Impressions: The actual coding portion of the assignment wasn't too hard; it was mainly really difficult because the instructions
were vague and unclear and the concept of union find structures was hard to grasp.

Problem 1: How does doubling N affect the running time?

Problem 2: How does doubling T affect the running time?

Problem 3: Measure running time (using calls to System.currentTimeMillis)
of the three versions of your program (DFS, Quick Find, and weighted quick
union with path compression).
3A DFS: 
3B Quick Find:
3C Weighted quick union with path compression:

Problem 4: Give a formula (using Big-Oh notation) of the running time on your computer (in seconds) as a function of both N and T.

Problem 5: Estimate the largest experiment you could  perform in one
[minute, day, year] assuming your computer has enough memory.
5A 1 minute:
5B 1 day:
5C 1 year:

Problem 6: Give a formula (using Big-Oh notation) that describes the amount
of memory (in bytes) that your IPercolate implementation consumes as a function of N.
6A DFS: 
6B Quick Find:
6C Weighted quick union with path compression:
